Prompts I used:

Do a program in C which makes the VERLET algorithm. We need a file with the initial position 'pos.txt', initial velocities 'velo.txt' and masses 'mass.txt' for which the data will be in lines separated. We will be doing a simulation of the solar system with constants 'G'. Make the program to have the Sun and the Earth included and give me the parameters that I need to include in the files

Now i want it to be reescalated. The new position will be the position divided by 1 AU. The new time is t = (GM/c^3)^(1/2)t where G is the gravitational constant, M the mass of the sun and c=1,49610^11 meters. The new mass will be the normal mass divided by the mass of the sun.

The reescale is wrong, the result is always 1 in the position

Delete the reescale. Now i want it to be 2D

Now plot it

even though i saved it in the same folder the python script does not open it, why?

Now make it animated

Could you make it a bit faster?

Now I want to plot the energy to see if it is constant, reprogram the program in C to calculate the energy and plot it

It says ValueError: not enough values to unpack: x,y,z = map(float, parts[2:]) expected 3, got 2

Now it is not animated the trajectory and I do not see the energy. Separate the plots

I dont want to see the energy, please retrieve the code of that without energy

And the c part too please

It does not work, please use the code I have now for future reference

Now, i want to have ALL of the solar system. give me the data for the position, mass and velocities for it
